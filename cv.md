About myself

I have about 15 years of experience in the technical field, including 4 years of experience in commercial application development. In my work, I pay great attention to the quality and structure of the code, as I believe that this makes it easier to maintain the code and minimizes bugs. What is important to me in my work is a friendly atmosphere in the team, interesting tasks and maintaining a work-life balance.
